\section*{Abstract}
Meta-Casanova is a functional, declarative, and simply-typed language designed to write compilers.
In this paper, we extend the language with type constructors and a module system to allow generic abstractions like parser monads and monad transformers. These abstractions are invaluable to compiler-writers as they help manage the complexity of modern-day compilers.
