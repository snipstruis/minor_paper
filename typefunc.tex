\subsection{TypeFunc Details}
TypeFuncs were designed to be consistent with the already existing Funcs.
This has a few implications:

\subsubsection*{TypeFuncs curry}
like Funcs, TypeFuncs curry.

Currying enables partially application.
For example, imagine we have a state monad.

\begin{code}
  TypeFunc "StateMonad" ⇒ ∗ ⇒ ∗ ⇒ ∗
\end{code}

\noindent Where the first argument represents the state type and the second the return type.
This means you can define a new state monad that already has its state-type specified by writing \verb|Monad(StateMonad int)|.

It also gives the compiler a uniform way to handle type and function application,
so this feature increases orthogonality while not increasing compiler complexity.

\subsubsection*{Double arrows (⇒)}
We choose double arrows for TypeFuncs to clearly differentiate them from function application(→).
This distinction is to seperate run-time from compile-time.

This is unlike Haskell, it uses single arrows (→).
Haskell can do this because it does not have the explicit run-time/compile-time distinction Meta-Casanova has.

\subsubsection*{Typefunc premises}
Typefuncs can have premises, just like rules.
This means that TypeFuncs can behave just like rules and can compute arbitrary expressions at compile-time.
The only limit is that values can't be passed at compile-time, as that would require dependent types.

\subsubsection*{TypeAliases}
\texttt{TypeAlias} declarations are the mechanism for declaring type-level two-way relationships between kinds.
This is analogous to the relationship \texttt{Data} declarations describe between types.
TypeAliases enable kind-level pattern-matching in TypeFuncs, essential for making them behave like Funcs.
