\section{The Problem}
\begin{multicols}{2}
  Parser monads are a useful tool for writing compilers.
  They are not only useful in the lexing stage,
  as they can be used for interpreting intermediate representations.

  The best thing about monadic parsing is that it is \textit{composable}.
  It is possible to combine multiple parsers into a single parser.
  For example: there might be a parser (\texttt{digit}) that can parse a single digit,
  and another (\texttt{repeat}) that can apply a parser multiple times until it fails.
  It is then trivial to combine these into a new parser.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml]
  (* parses multiple digits *)
  let digits = repeat digit
  \end{lstlisting} 

  A parser is a function that takes an input stream and a context and returns a result.
  A generic implementation may look like this.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml]
  type Parser<'char,'ctxt,'result> =
    List<'char> * 'ctxt
      -> Result<'char,'ctxt,'result>
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  The Result contains ---if everything went well--- the value returned by the parser, the modified context, and the new input stream position.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml]
  type Result<'char,'ctxt,'result> = 
    | Done  of 'result*List<'char>*'ctxt
    | Error of string
  \end{lstlisting}

  It may not be obvious, but the parser monad can be constructed from more primitive monads.
  The input stream and the context are represented as state-monads, and the result is an either-monad.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml]
  type Parser<'char,'ctxt,'result> =
    State<List<'char>,
          State<'ctxt,
                Either<result,'error>>
  \end{lstlisting}
  EDIT: could be\\
  \texttt{State<List<'char>*'ctxt,Either<...>>}?

  TODO:
  monad transformers are a way to easily define a parser monad in terms of other monads.
  trying to figure out what type system we need.
  we need subtyping for general monads ($\lambda_{<:}$)\footcite[Chapter~15]{Pierce02}.
  we require type constructors for monad transformers ($F^\omega_{<:}$)\footcite[Chapter~31]{Pierce02}.
  added benefits are arbitrary static analysis.
