\subsection{Meta-Casanova}
\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent
  Meta-Casanova uses a syntax similar to natural deduction.
  A rule is comprised of a line with below it on the left of the arrow the input, and on the right the output.
  Above the line are premises that are executed sequentially.

  Meta-Casanova uses pattern-matching at compile-time to find out what function implementation will be called.

  Multiple rules may match at any given time.
  If this happens, the program execution splits into multiple branches.
  Each following one rule.
  If none of the rules match, the branch dies off. 
  
  This branch-and-die paradigm is very useful for writing parsers.
  For example: when a numeric digit is encountered,
  it is unclear whether an integer is being parsed or when a floating point literal is being parsed. 
  In Meta-Casanova, you just write two rules.
  One that matches digits followed by a delimiter,
  and another that matches digits followed by a dot and optionally more digits.

  Data Expr → "|" → Expr → Expr
  
  
  eval a → TRUE
