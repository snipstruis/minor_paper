\subsection{TypeFunc Details}
\begin{multicols}{2}
  \subsubsection*{Everything curries}
  Everything curries because it was the most consistent from a language perspective.
  This also gives the compiler a uniform way to handle application.
  
  \subsubsection*{Typefuncs have premises}
  Maximum expressivity. (TODO: usecase here)
  General and consistent system that works everywhere.
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Module Details}
\begin{multicols}{2}
  \subsubsection*{Scope contents}
  everything is possible
  \subsubsection*{Modules declare new kinds}
  Simplest solution was to reuse the \texttt{TypeFunc} system for compile-time tasks.
  Possible problem in future with Dependent types: kind name space will then consist of module names and type names.
  \subsubsection*{inheritance propegation}
  difference between imports and inherits.
\end{multicols}
