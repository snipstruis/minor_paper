\section{Introduction}
A strong type system is essential for a modern language.
They enable powerful abstractions to happen at compile-time,
making it ideal for a fast compiler language.

Because the focus of Meta-Casanova is on writing compilers,
we begin with a brief overview of monadic parsing.
We will discover that parser monads can be constructed from more elementary monads,
and that there is a simple way to combine these monads into a parser monad.
We will then find that we need a stronger typesystem than is currently supported by Meta-Casanova
and that we need to extend it with Modules and Type Operators.
The rest of the paper will go in detail on the design of this type system.

This paper is one of three papers written for the Meta-Casanova minor.
The focus of this paper is about the type system and the modules we have developed during the minor.
To learn more about the syntax and semantics of Meta-Casanova, refer to the paper by Jarno Holstein\cite{holstein16}.
To learn about the evolution of the standard library of Meta-Casanova and its applications, refer to the paper by Louis van der Burg\cite{vanderburg16}.
