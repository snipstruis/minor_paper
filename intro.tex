\section*{Abstract}
Meta-Casanova is a functional and declarative language designed for writing compilers. 
It is still a language in development and is only simply-typed.
In this paper, we extend the language with type constructors and a module system to allow greater abstractions like generic monad transformers.

  > problem: lack of abstractions. specifically higher-order polymorphic types and subtyping.

  > need subtyping and polymorphic types to make generic monads.

  > need higher-order polymorphic types to make monad-transformers.

  > need monad-transformers for composable monads (list of state of option)

  > need composable monads to make parser monad (state of state of option)
