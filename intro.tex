\section{Introduction}
A strong type system is essential for a functional language.
It enables powerful abstractions like monad transformers to happen at compile-time,
making it ideal for a fast compiler language.

Because the focus of Meta-Casanova is on writing compilers,
we begin with a brief overview of monadic parsing.
We show that parser monads can be constructed from more elementary monads,
and that there is a simple way to combine these monads into a parser monad.
We then show that we need a stronger typesystem than what is currently supported by Meta-Casanova
and that we need to extend it with Modules and Type Operators.
Furthermore, we will discuss in detail the design of this type system.

The focus of this paper is about the type system and the modules we have developed during the minor.
