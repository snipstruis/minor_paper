\section*{Abstract}
Meta-Casanova is a functional and declarative language designed for writing compilers. 
It is still a language in development and is only simply-typed.
In this paper, we extend the language with type constructors and a module system to allow abstractions like generic monad transformers.
\section{Introduction}
A strong type system is essential for a modern language.
They enable powerful abstractions to happen at compile-time,
making it ideal for a fast compiler language.

Because the focus of Meta-Casanova is on writing compilers,
we begin with a brief overview of monadic parsing.
We will discover that parser monads can be constructed from more elementary monads,
and that there is a simple way to combine these monads into a parser monad.
We will then find that we need a stronger typesystem than is currently supported by Meta-Casanova
and that we need to extend it with Modules and Type Operators.
The rest of the paper will go in detail on the design of this type system.

This paper is one of three papers written for the Meta-Casanova minor.
The focus of this paper is about the type system and the modules we have developed during the minor.
