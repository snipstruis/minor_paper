\section{Introduction}
(catchy intro here?)

Because the focus of Meta-Casanova is on writing compilers,
we begin with a brief overview of monadic parsing.
We will discover that parser monads can be constructed from more elementary monads,
and that there is a simple way to combine these monads into a parser monad.
We will then find that we need a stronger typesystem than is supported in Meta-Casanova
and that we need to extend it with Modules and Type Operators.
The rest of the paper will go in detail on the design for this type system.
